# KKnD Tileset recreation project

Due to the fact the original tilesets for kknd are lost, and due to the fact that kknd maps are huge bitmaps which contain a lot of hand edited elements, the build-in assets are not usable for custom map making.
The goal of this project is to recreate a tileset which looks as exact as possible to the original KKnD tilesets, providing all elements required for modern map making.

Contributions are accepted as long as they meet these particular conditions:
- Tiles must properly blend with adjacent tiles
- Tiles must fit the 8 directional / 45 degree setup of the game
- Tiles must look good even when it is just one tile used repeatedly on its own
- Tiles must use the KKnD color palette
